# 1D Bin Packing
Solving the 1D Bin Packing Problem using meta-heuristic algorithm (Firebug Swarm Optimisation Algorithm)

### Prerequisites:
Please install the following packages before running the program:

    Python
    numpy
    scipy

Alternatively, one can use the environment.yml to install all the dependencies. `conda env create -f environment.yml` will serve the purpose.


### To Run

In fso folder, run the script:
```
python fso.py
```
